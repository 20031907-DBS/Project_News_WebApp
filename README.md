# Project_News_WebApp

1. Recently, Trust over news agencies has seen a drop due to n number of reasons.
2. This has resulted in losing faith over these agencies that were supposed to inform and educate civilians and hence the revenue drop
3. Current gap is widening slowly and with new upcoming generation it will increase even more i think as more people are switching to social media platform for their news sources
4. A major issue lies in the current structure of news websites, where users are bombarded with an overwhelming amount of content, much of which is driven by the interests of the agencies themselves, often dictated by funding, sponsors, or advertisers  --> civilians do not want that
5. This creates a sense of distrust and detachment among readers.
6. Hence new generation is switching to social platforms but mostly are unaware there is an issue to content manipulation, algorithmic manipulation and pushing content based on engagement
7. This is even Worse than traiditional news agencies -> This increases the rate of creating echo chambers and polarization of public opinion -> leaving up with fragmented society .
8. so civilians are kinda stuck in middle and are their opinions are being played upon rather what civilian want i.e crystal clear news with authenticity / responsibiltity
# Business_solution
points of requirment: switching resonsibility to article writers and they would be face of news agencies and not the news agencies itself.
I propose the creation of a news web app that woud be a spin version of news agencies in the realm of social media targeting new generation than than the traditional model of news delivery. The platform will be a hybrid of social media engagement and responsible journalism, focusing on article writers (independent journalists, reporters, and subject matter experts) rather than traditional news agencies. Writers will create and submit articles directly to the platform, bypassing the need for intermediary news agencies.

## The core objective is to solve key problems faced by today's news agencies ecosystem:
Restoring Trust in News agencies :
how? -> what do people do on social media like Twitter/X ? 
They follow their favorite people within their interested topics.
:::By focusing on individual article writers, the platform can provide more transparent, unbiased, and trustworthy reporting. Users will have a clearer understanding of who is writing the news and can choose to follow writers they trust.
:::
These writers will have a liscence/ tag from news agencies

2. Honestly this will also reduce information overload over users
3. there is a growing Demand for Ethical, Independent News
.
.
conclude: This platform represents a refreshing shift from the traditional, corporate-dominated news ecosystem to one that empowers individual writers and restores trust in the news cycle

### [No real time communication in the beginning as we are focusing on CURD webapp + api integration + SPA ==> priority]

---later as users are if they are using the product ill add new features and scale it further 

Tech stack to be focused:(May Change as thigns are developing)
Nodejs, Nextjs , Database(relational) (not yet decided) 
Firebase for auth (may change ) 
will deploy Iaas (will pick up learnings from networking class) 
CI/CD - Github actions 
# No focus on website UI
